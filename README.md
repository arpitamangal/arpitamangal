## Hello there :) 
**Welcome to My Profile!**

I am an analytics professional with 3 years of work experience. I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Business Analytics (STEM) and seeking full-time positions. My interest lies in customer and marketing analytics with implementations of MMM, NLP, Experimentation, and Hypothesis testing.
 
### Fun Fact: Online shopping introduced me to Analytics!

Given the remote location of my undergraduate campus, I found myself relying heavily on online shopping. My curiosity about product recommendations sparked a fascination with Analytics. Through a blend of e-learning, flexible courses, and internships, I pursued knowledge in this field. Drawn by the excitement of data science and machine learning, I was inspired to take on a new challenge – dipping my toes into the waters of software engineering.

Upon completing my degree, I joined Barclays, where I immersed myself in iOS development. Simultaneously, I dedicated time to self-initiated machine learning projects, nurturing my passion. However, my aspiration for a full-time career in Data Science led me to join Kotak Securities. Here, I engaged deeply in customer and marketing analytics, thriving under an exceptional manager.

Yet, a persistent concern lingered – the absence of formal education in Analytics and Machine Learning. Fueled by a lifelong dream of pursuing education abroad, I turned to my manager for guidance. His invaluable advice steered me towards the Business Analytics program that blended my robust technical acumen with a strong business focus. This journey proved transformative, refining my ability to tackle complex problems and craft effective analytical solutions.

More resolute than ever, I am now eager to embrace full-time opportunities in Data Science and Analytics.
